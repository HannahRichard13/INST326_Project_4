INST326_Project4
Improving Code From Project 3

Project Description:

**** The file paths in this code located in the open_notebook, save_notebook, and submit_edit methods may need to be changed depending on the computer this program is being run on.

*** This program uses a mdoule called noteform_module that must be in the same working directory as this code when it is being run

This program allows the user to create notes and save them to a notebook. 
It also allows the user to edit their previous notes and tracks the users edit history.

The three improvements made to this note program:
 - the creation of my own module called noteform_module
 - improved overall display and aesthetics, including the addition of a scroll bar
 - the addition of a note counter

To create a new note, hit the new note button and enter your note data.
To save this note to your computer, hit the save notebook button and it will allow you to save your note to your computer.
Once you have created your notes, you can hit the open notebook button.
This will show you a preview of all the ntoes you have just created.
If you click on a note preview, it will open a new window of the full note and show the user all of the data associated with that note.
When you click on the specific note, it will allow you to edit the note by htting the edit note button located on the bottom of the window.
When you hit the edit note button, you can edit the content of note in all sections including title, text, tags, links, and author.
When you submit your edits by hitting the submit button, your edited note gets saved.
Once you close all the tabs except for the Main Window, you can reopen the notebook using the open notebook button.
Once you reopen the notebook by hitting the notebook button, it will show you your orignal notes as well as the edited notes with their timestamp.

In the Content_folder, it holds a combination of my 10 notes/snippets.
